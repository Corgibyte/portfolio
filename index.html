        <p>I was born and raised in Montana, but have found my home in the beautiful Pacific Northwest. I have many years working in clinical laboratories working with complex health information systems, specimen processing, and assisting healthcare staff with laboratory questions and problems. 
            I enjoy technical problems and working with a team. I am currently enrolled in Epicodus' full-time full-stack program and look forward to improving my programming skills.

        I love to ski, play video games, and spend time with my three dogs.
